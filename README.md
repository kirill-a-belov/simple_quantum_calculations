# Simple quantum computing on Go (Golang)

We don't exactly know, when humanity will make stable quantum computers are able to proper calculations. 
But we can try quantum computing (quantum programming) already now.
I've made a quantum primitives which, however, allow to produce some simple quantumm calculations 
on high level PL (Golang, GQPL). It has a Qbit model, set of unary and binary Qbits operation (gates) and some 
high level programming operations.
